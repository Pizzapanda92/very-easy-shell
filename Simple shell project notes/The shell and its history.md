We will answer couple of questions regarding the shell and its history. 

#### First let's understand what is a Unix shell ?

A shell is a command line interpreter, through the terminal (its user interface) we can interact with the system. 

All Unix shells provide filename wildcarding, piping, here documents, command substitution, variables and control structures for condition-testing and iteration.

The shell is a program that execute other program and also start-ups scripts such as the GUI of an operating system. Another approach is to use an array of software see 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systemd

#### Who designed and implemented the original Unix operating system ?

The first Unix shell was design by Ken Thompson, it is the Thompson shell. It includes basic feature like "pipping" (see the Pipe [[table_operators_in_c.png]]) basic control structure like:

- if
- goto
- filename wildcarding 

At first the Unix shell did not include scripting, this came afterwards. 


#### Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell

Ken Thompson an engineer at Bell labs invented the Unix shell which he based on the Multics shell.  

The Unix shell was distributed between 1971 and 1975 for the Unix version from 1 to 6. 

#### Who invented the B programming language (the direct predecessor to the C programming language)

Also Ken Thompson, the B programming language is a typeless programming language. The language uses memory word (sort of instructions in binary...not sure). During the 70's ASCII became popular and as ASCII can encode word in some bytes the B language was less effective. 

At this moment our fellow Ken Thompson and his friend Denis Ritchie both developers at Bell labs invented [[The C language]].

#### Who is Ken Thompson

One of the GOAT.
